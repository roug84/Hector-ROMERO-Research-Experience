However, it is well known that they require a large number of neurons to deal with complex systems. Numerous neurons favour a better approximation but lead to a more complex model, and higher computational cost. To address this problem, in my thesis, I proposed a complete system identification methodology leading balanced accuracy, complexity and computational cost neural network-based models. Moreover, for the cases where training data contain outliers, I included a robust estimation approach.  \r\n\r\nThe main contributions presented in my thesis, are now published in four journal papers [5-8]:\r\n\r\nIn a first paper [5], I proposed a dedicated neural network design and an original model reduction approach in order to improve the balance between complexity and accuracy of black box nonlinear system identification models. The proposed neural network design, based on a recurrent three-layer architecture, helps to reduce the number of parameters of the model after the training phase without any loss of estimation accuracy. The reduction procedure is developed in two steps. The first step consists in training the proposed architecture under two nonrestrictive assumptions. In the second step, the recurrent three-layer neural network is transformed into a representation of two layers with a significantly reduced number of parameters. \r\n\r\nIn a second paper [6] I focused on the improvement of the computational cost required to achieve the balanced simplicity-accuracy models presented in [5]. More precisely, the improvement consists of a significantly computational cost reduction of the neural network-training phase.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate that the two assumptions, required to achieve the model complexity and computational cost reduction procedures, are not restrictive, I derived different model families [7]. These models were used for identifying different dynamic systems. Results validate the interest of this complete system identification approach.\r\n\r\nFinally, I proposed an estimation algorithm robust to outliers. Classically, the model's parameters minimize a L2-norm-based criterion. However, when using strongly corrupted data, namely outliers, the L2-norm-based estimation algorithms become ineffective. To ensure both, balance between simplicity and accuracy, and robustness to outliers, I proposed a robust estimation algorithm [8], based on the minimization of the Huberian function, for training the neuromodels presented in [5-7].\r\n\r\nTo validate the system identification approaches presented in [5-8] different systems were identified. For instances, a Wiener-Hammerstein benchmark system, a robot arm, a real-world benchmark regression problem (delta elevators), an acoustic duct, and a piezoelectric actuator were identified. Comparisons with others black box system identification methods shown that the proposed methodology yielded, in all the application cases, the best balance between simplicity, accuracy, and computational cost. Moreover, results on the identification of the piezoelectric actuator, which output data contain strong natural outliers, shown that the proposed robust estimation approach yields significantly better performances than the others black box methods.  \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use.

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
